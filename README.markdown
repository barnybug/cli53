cli53 - Command line script to administer the Amazon Route 53 dns service
=========================================================================

Introduction
------------
The latest Amazon service Route 53 is a great addition, but only has a rudimentary set of tools
available at the time of release. This script fills that gap until things have caught up.

Features:

- create hosted zones

- delete hosted zones

- list hosted zones

- import to BIND format

- export to BIND format

- create resource records

- delete resource records

- works with BIND format zone files we all know and love - no need to edit
  &lt;ChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest&gt; XML!

Getting Started
---------------

Create a hosted zone:

	$ bin/cli53 create example.com

Check what we've done:

	$ bin/cli53 list

Import a BIND zone file:

	$ bin/cli53 import example.com --file zonefile.txt

Replace with an imported zone, waiting for completion:

	$ bin/cli53 import example.com --file zonefile.txt --replace --wait

Manually create some records:

	$ bin/cli53 rrcreate example.com www A 192.168.0.1 --ttl 3600
	$ bin/cli53 rrcreate example.com www A 192.168.0.2 --ttl 3600 --replace
	$ bin/cli53 rrcreate example.com '' MX '10 192.168.0.1' '20 192.168.0.2'

Export as a BIND zone file (useful for checking):

	$ bin/cli53 export example.com

Further documentation is available, e.g.:

	$ bin/cli53 --help
	$ bin/cli53 rrcreate --help


Installation
------------

### Buildout Install
Buildout will download all the dependencies needed in order to run cli53.

	$ python bootstrap.py
	$ bin/buildout

Once the dependencies downloaded, run cli53

	$ bin/cli53
 
If the step bin/buildout fails with the cryptic error message
'pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: distribute', then you might try
bootstrap.py with distribute instead of setuptools:

	$ python bootstrap.py --distribute
	$ bin/buildout

You need to set your Amazon credentials in the environment as AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY or configure them in ~/.boto. For more information see:
http://code.google.com/p/boto/wiki/BotoConfig

Caveats
-------
As Amazon limits operations to a maximum of 100 changes, if you
perform a large operation that changes over 100 resource records it
will be split. An operation that involves deletes, followed by updates
such as an import with --replace will very briefly leave the domain
inconsistent. You have been warned!
